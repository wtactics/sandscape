Green Shield, v1.1
==================

Focus
-----

Green Shield will maintain the fast pace development but will try to slow and 
bring a bit more control to the development process. The main goal is still to 
create a usable version soon, allowing users to test the software and to get 
feedback. The most important part of this iteration will be the game actions that 
need to be complete and at least have basic performance tests done.

See milestone footenote:[http://sourceforge.net/apps/trac/sandscape/query?status=assigned&status=new&status=accepted&status=reopened&status=closed&group=status&milestone=Green.Shield]
 page for a list of planned tasks to be executed in this iteration and our roadmap 
footnote:[http://sourceforge.net/apps/trac/sandscape/roadmap] an overview of our 
development path.

Difficulties
------------

All tasks were implemented without incidents.
[edit]Achievements

We managed to make the system more stable, though several tasks are yet to complete 
and many views are just place holders that will be updated in the next iterations.

Game interface was tested and tested and we found several performance problems that, 
although mitigated, were not committed to the this iteration tag.

Next
----

Next iteration will focus on increasing the stability of the server and the game 
interface code and on optimizing the code to allow better performance on AJAX 
requests and interactions.
