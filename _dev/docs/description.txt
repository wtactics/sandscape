System Description
==================

DEPRECATED!

This file contains an overall description of *SandScape* and it's features 
allowing for new users to get an overview of how the system works and at the 
same time giving the developers a path to follow and a way to assess the 
project's development.

System Administration
---------------------

An administration area must be provided that allows the configuration of 
*SandScape*. Though most *SandScape's* focus is on providing a place to play 
WTactics, some administration is needed:

a. User management;
b. Card management;
c. Sync options for synchronization with *Cardscape*;
d. Overview of deleted items and cleanup options;
e. Log management;
f. CMS options for static pages;

a) User management
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Administrators must be able to manage existing users using a list of users that 
gives them access to options for editing a user's data, activation a user or 
deleting a user from the system.

b) Card management
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The creation of new cards, removal of existing ones, or editing the details of 
and image of a card.

c) Sync options
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If a synchronization method is created between *SandScape* and *Cardscape*, an 
administrator should have to option to activate/deactivate the sync feature.

Though this feature may be useful for WTactics, using the *Cardscape* 
information could prove useless to some other project or community, therefor 
being able to deactivate synchronization is important.

d) Cleanup options
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Various cleanup options, such as existing logs, deleted cards and images, 
statistics, game data, etc.

The administrator should be able to reduce the system's space foot print.

e) Log management
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Ability to export logs, view or delete logs. Could be merged with the above 
_cleanup options_.

f) CMS options
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

There are a few pages in *SandScape* that could have their text changed, namely 
the front page, maybe a help page or about area.

_Themes/Templates are not important for now_.

Users
-----

The user area, or profile area, is where the user can manage it's information:

a. Profile data;
b. Card information;
c. Decks;
d. Personal messages;

a) Profile data
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The user account, where he can change he's profile information regarding he's 
account.

b) Card information
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A user can add cards to the system, or use existing cards. If the user wants to 
add new cards he must provide all the card's details and a card image.

He can also delete existing cards or change any card he has added himself. A 
new card can be made public and be available for everyone to use or be private.

_Note: undecided_. If a card is public, then the user will not be able to edit 
or remove the card if other users have create decks with the mentioned card.

c) Decks
~~~~~~~~

As a fundamental piece playing, a user needs to be able to create decks of 
cards that are then used when starting a game. Multiple decks can be created 
and choosed for playing.

d) Personal messages
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

As an extra features, users could send and receive personal messages that 
should be sent to the user's e-mail and also be stored in the system.


Lobby
-----

The lobby is the central place for users, the area where they go in order to 
create games, see who is online, join existing games as players or spectators, 
etc.

It should allow the user to:

a. Chat with other players that are also in the lobby;
b. Search for games;
c. Join existing games;
d. Create new games and wait for other players;

a) Chat with players
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The lobby is a place where players gather, therefor it must provide a way for 
users to communicate. A simple chat application IRC room like.

b) Search for games
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In order to play, a user must either create a game or choose an existing one. 
The user can search for games by listing all active games without all the 
needed players or by typing the HASH for the game.

c) Join existing games
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Joining a game allows the user to play against other users or to watch a match 
between two players. After finding the game in question, the user must choose 
either to play or to watch.

d) Create new games
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Allows the user to create a new game from the lobby screen.

Game
----

The main playing area. The game area is where the game is played and it's 
interface is different from the rest of the system. Here the players can chat, 
play with the cards from their chosen deck or watch a game between other 
players.

Site/Global
-----------

a. Login/logout
b. See stats
c. See list of users

a. Login/logout
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Though free for all, the system should provide basic authentication mechanism,
allowing the users to login and logout of the system.

b. See stats
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Some statistical information about played games should be offered.

_Note_ yet to determine._

c. See list of users
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Allows every user to see a list of existing users. Should also allow for 
sending messages or e-mails.

Entities
--------

.Description
[horizontal]
User:: Contains every information needed for a user account. This is the user 
entity representing any user with authenticated access to the system. +
There are two types of users, a normal player and an administrator. No other 
permission scheme is to be created, just a simple separation between admins and 
regular users.

Card:: Represents a card that can be used in the creation of decks. A card can 
either come from *Cardscape*, be imported by the admins or created by any 
normal user.

Deck:: A group of cards. Made up of:

Game:: Represents a game, either one already played or in any of the different 
states (waiting, finished, canceled, running). The game is the most important
entity.

Chat:: A group of messages that are shared by different interested users, a 
chat is only intended to register the common information about a communication 
chanel and can be associated with a game or be free, and thus creating the 
lobby chat. +
The lobby chat is the only chat that has no game associated and there should be 
only one active, non game related, chat. Every user that accesses the lobby is 
automatically registered to this chat.

ChatMessage:: A message sent by a user to a given chat.

CardImage:: An image associated with a card. This entity registers the image 
files uploaded when creating cards and has only the necessary fields to 
recreate the file for the browser.

Message:: A message sent using the personal message system.
